# PolyP3HT
## Polymerize Atomistic P3HT

Handy script to generate topology (based on https://goo.gl/2xDutZ ) and geometry files of arbitrarily long P3HT chains.
The released version (which works for the published parameters in [JACS 139 (10), 3697-3705](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.6b11717) can be found on [my Figshare page](https://figshare.com/articles/Polymerize_Atomistic_P3HT/5853060).
