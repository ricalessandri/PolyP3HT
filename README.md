# PolyP3HT : Polymerize Atomistic P3HT

Handy script to generate topology and geometry files of arbitrarily long atomistic P3HT chains.

Two force fields are available:

1. The GROMOS 53A6-based parameters published in 
[JACS **2017**, *139*, 3697-3705](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.6b11717) - see the **`2017RA-JACS`** folder; 

2. The "Q-Forced" parameters (still relying on the GROMOS 53A6 Lennard-Jones parameters) published
in [Chemrxiv **2020**](10.26434/chemrxiv.12277931) - see the **`2020RA-qforce`** folder.
This version improves the bonded parameters of P3HT, which were otherwise too flexible 
with the GROMOS standard parameters for angles and improper dihedrals in particular. 
This model is *recommended for use in combination with subsequent quantum chemical calculations* 
on the P3HT geometries (see, *e.g*, [Chemrxiv **2020**](10.26434/chemrxiv.12277931)).

Both can be also downloaded from [Figshare](http://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5853060), 
which contains also a few example files obtained with the scripts.
"Stable" releases will be uploaded to [Figshare](http://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5853060),
while this repo is a good place where to raise issues or make improvements.


## Use

```
cd 2017RA-JACS
./PolyP3HT.sh       12   # on Linux
./PolyP3HT-macOS.sh 12   # on macOS
```

where 12 is the desired number of monomers (note only that the number of monomers in the chain *must* 
be a multiple of 2). 
Note that the files `shift-resnr.py`, `residuetypes.dat`, `p3ht_dimer_repeat_unit_50atoms.gro`, `header`, 
and `top2itp.sh` must be in the folder where the script is being exectured along with the directory 
`p3ht_gromos_v_2017RA-JACS.ff/` which contains the force field.
The commands are analogous for the `2020RA-qforce` version. 
The output files are in GROMACS format (`itp` and `gro` for the topology and geometry, respectively).
More details are also included in the Supporting Information of [Chemrxiv **2020**](10.26434/chemrxiv.12277931).
